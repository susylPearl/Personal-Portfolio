## Personal Portfolio

#### Problem And Solution:
We are technical person and we deals with different technologies to showcase our talent. Submitting personal Resume in email to number of people for explaining our skills is quite timeconsuming. So, developing portfolio site and host somewhere can help different people to reach out me.

I developed here my personal portfolio where i can showcase my skills and resume is attached which can be downloaded. All other informations including my qualifications can be found here. Also any one can contact me with this application.

This project mainly deals with FrontEnd related task.

ReactJs, Typescript, Redux as state container, Hooks, CSS, Nodemailer as library and Express Server is used in this project.

#### Technical Choice and Architecture:

I have developed this application as single page app, in which ReactJs with Redux is used which helps me to create modular, scalable and robust application. Typescript is used for static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features. I can test each module of this app individually with Jest Testing Framework. I have seperated the Server and Client app and different scripts are listed below for running them.

#### Available scripts to run project:

In the project root directory, you can run:

### `yarn frontend`

Runs the client app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn backend`

Runs the express server in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the client app and server concurrently.<br />

### `yarn test`

Run the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

**Note: Server is setup correctly for contact email sending feature using nodemailer library, but got some issue, so routing on server URL is not working. you can run client app to test the result.**

#### TODO Task:
- Integrate with Server and contact Email work correctly.
- Increase Test case coverage for existing components.
- Add one more Tab for `Blog` section where i can share my technical knowledge.
- Implement `Material-UI` React UI framework for increasing UI/UX design features.
- Modify `CSS` to `less` file.
- Responsive design implementation.
